projects:
- name: Representing words & concepts

  role: NoCe members, Dr. Piazza & friends
  url: "posts/research/representing/"
  summary: What are the neuro-cognitive correlates of semantic knowledge? So far, we have seen that concepts are encoded in distributed yet specialized cortical network.

- name: Loosing words & concepts

  role:  NoCe members, Drs. Gorno-Tempini & Lukic
  url: "posts/research/loosing/"
  summary: We are studying how degraded neural semantic representations have strong effects on behavior and how they can be partially compensated.
