# your projects
projects:
- name: Representing words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, NCCR EvoLang colleagues
  url: "posts/research/representing/"
  summary: What are the neuro-cognitive correlates of semantic knowledge? We use neuroimaging to study the distributed yet specialized cortical networks involved.
  tags: ["fMRI","MEG"]

- name: Losing words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role:  NoCe members, Drs. Gorno-Tempini, Laganaro & Lukic
  url: "posts/research/losing/"
  summary: We study which brain lesions can lead to degraded neural semantic representations, their effects on behavior, and how their loss can be partially compensated.
  tags: ["MEG", "NPsyc"]

- name: Learning words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, Drs. Piazza, Vigano & Bilgin
  url: "posts/research/learning/"
  summary: We are interested in how cogntive and neural representations of concepts (and words) are built in the first place - how do we label concepts?
  tags: ["fMRI", "EEG"]

- name: Concepts across languages
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, NCCR EvoLang colleagues
  url: "posts/research/multi/"
  summary: In both healthy and patological conditions, we study cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences in language processing and semantic representations.
  tags: ["fMRI", "Behav",  "NPsyc"]

- name: Concepts & words across people
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, CNeuromod colleagues
  url: "posts/research/langnetwork/"
  summary: We are interested in individual differences in language processing, as well as in differences between biological and artificial representations of concepts.
  tags: ["fMRI", "Comp"]

- name: Above & beyond langauge
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCE members, Drs. Pouget & Pinheiro-Chagas
  url: "posts/research/math/"
  summary: We study the interaction of language and other cognitive functions, for example mathematical cognition and executive control.
