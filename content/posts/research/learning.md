We compared function and morphology of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) in typically developing (14) and dyslexic (26) children. Dyslexics show less functional neural tuning to words and less orientation coherence, yet similar neurite density. Thus, dyslexia appears associated with both functional and morphological alterations in vOT.
