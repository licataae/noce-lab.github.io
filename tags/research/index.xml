Finally, Iâ€™ve studied how damages to language-related networks can affect or spare semantic knowledge, highlighting the critical role of the ATL (Borghesani et al., NeuroImage:Clinical, 2020).</description></item><item><title>Representing words &amp; concepts</title><link>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/representing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 07:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/representing/</guid><description>Semantic knowledge is encoded in distributed yet specialized cortical representations, with crucial topographical dissociations describing a posterior-to-anterior gradient from perceptual to conceptual features (Borghesani et al., Neuroimage, 2016; Fig.1a). I highlighted the effect played by the task (Borghesani et al., JoCN, 2019) and that sharing cortical resources across tasks and stimuli does not equate to sharing a neural code (Borghesani et al., Cortex, 2018; Fig.1b).</description></item></channel></rss>
