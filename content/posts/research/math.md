* Borghesani, V., de Hevia, M. D., Viarouge, A., Chagas, P. P., Eger, E., & Piazza, M. (2018). Processing number and length in the parietal cortex: Sharing resources, not a common code. Cortex.
Ten is more than seven. And 5 cm are more than 3 cm. How similar are the neural processes in action to perform these comparisons? Univariate analysis of  fMRI data suggest that both numerical and spatial magnitude comparisons recruit a bilateral occipito-parietal network. However, multivariate analysis indicate that the underlying representational content differ. Thus numerical and spatial magnitudes appear to share common neural resources, yet not a common neural code.
