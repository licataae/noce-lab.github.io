Degraded neural semantic representations have strong effects on behavior (Borghesani et al., Cortex, 2019) and how they can be partially compensated (Borghesani et al., Brain, 2020; Borghesani et al., Brain, 2021; Fig.1c). Finally, Iâ€™ve studied how damage to language-related networks can affect or spare semantic knowledge, highlighting the critical role of the ATL (Borghesani et al., NeuroImage:Clinical, 2020).
